# ERC-1155-benchmarks
Three Ethereum token standards, three Truffle unit tests with Gas benchmarks. 

```
# First off start by installing truffle if you don't have it installed globally yet.
$ npm install -g truffle
```
Next Install Ganache [here](https://truffleframework.com/ganache).

```
# Next off move to the directory of the token you'd like to test
$ truffle test
```

That should do it!
